  title: About Me
  description: |
    QA **Automation** with more than a decade of hands-on experience in software development.  
    **System Engineer**, certified in ISTQB (Foundation Level), and have passed the IELTS exam (International English
    Language Testing System).  
    <br>
    Accumulated a wealth of experience related to QA tasks (Manual, Hybrid & Automation).  
    As an Automation QA, I had the chance to work with Web-based applications and Mobile apps (Responsive and
    Native). For most projects, I have used Jira, Git, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Playwright, Cypress and JavaScript (or Selenium and Java) but I do
    have experience in some other programming languages as well (like TypeScript, Ruby, Node.js, Python, etc).  
    <br>
    Worked for companies like Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Renault and Nissan, among others.  
    Some of my professional skills are Teamwork, Proactivity and Leadership.
